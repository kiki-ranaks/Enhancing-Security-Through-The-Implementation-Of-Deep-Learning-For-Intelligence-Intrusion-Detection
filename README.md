# Enhancing-Security-Through-The-Implementation-Of-Deep-Learning-For-Intelligence-Intrusion-Detection
# Overview
This repository hosts the implementation of an intelligent intrusion detection system leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance security. The project employs GRU and LSTM classifiers to predict security attacks by monitoring network traffic, system behavior, and user activities in real-time.

# Features
->Utilizes advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques for anomaly-based intrusion detection.
->Preprocesses input datasets to handle missing values, noisy data, and inconsistencies.
->Implements feature selection to enhance model performance and reduce computational costs.
->Employs GRU and LSTM classifiers with gated mechanisms to mitigate gradient problems.
->Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, recall, f1score, and precision.
